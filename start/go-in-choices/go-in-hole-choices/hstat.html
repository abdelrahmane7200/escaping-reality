 <h1> As your going through this path, a man dressed as a YellowJacket attacks you and you faint. When you open your eyes, you realize you was "dreaming" and was all this time just in detention at High School Of Telecommunications and Technology. However just before you go back to sleep, a bomb gets thrown into the room and you die. </h1>
